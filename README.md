# NAGA E-BAKWIT
LINK: https://e-bakwit.onrender.com/
Github repository for fulfilling the requirements of IT Capstone Project 2.

Naga E-bakwit is a web-based system that aims to serve as a tool that would lessen the CSWDO’s workload by automating data processes such as demographic segregation and relief allocation. Through the implemented system, CSWDO and their volunteers are expected to consume less time and effort in accomplishing a DROMIC report, but most importantly, it would enable them to efficiently monitor the status of the evacuation centers in relation to the sheltered families that are temporarily in their care.

The main purpose of this project is mainly to provide an efficient and convenient evacuee logging and relief distribution assistance web-based system for the local government of Naga’s City Social Welfare and Development Office to assist them in disaster evacuation endeavors.
